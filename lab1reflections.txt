1b) What visibility should you use for the different methods and variables that the classes contain? Which interface should you expose?
ANS:The method that we used for variables is private and the reason for that, is the fact that the limiting the other classes to manipulate those variable.
 We have even changed the visibility of methods(setTurboOn, setTurboOff) to private becouse they are methods used only for Saab95. other classes dont need those methods and making them private is a great idea.
